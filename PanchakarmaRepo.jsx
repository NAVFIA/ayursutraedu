          transcript: "The preparation phase for Vamana therapy involves several important steps. First, the patient undergoes Snehana (oleation therapy) with medicated oils for 3-7 days to prepare the body. This is followed by Swedana (sudation therapy) to open the channels and soften the toxins. The patient is given a specific diet and lifestyle modifications. Internal oleation with ghee or oil is administered to mobilize toxins from deep tissues to the digestive tract. This phase typically lasts 7-10 days and is crucial for the success of the main procedure."

The process continues until the patient vomits clear water, indicating complete cleansing. This procedure typically lasts 2-4 hours and requires skilled supervision. The patient may experience 8-12 bouts of vomiting to achieve complete purification of the upper digestive tract and respiratory system."
